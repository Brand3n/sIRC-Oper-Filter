sIRC Oper FIlter - A perl script designed to filter an IRC-Op's (snotices)
tab to be more human readable. Built to run on Inspire IRCd.

This little perl script gets loaded into an IRC-Op's X-Chat, and takes
care of the rest itself. It takes status of the message and places it to
the left of the margin and places the actual message to the right, making
it much more human readable and easier on the eyes. This partciular
version was built for a light background, so you may have to edit it for
darker backgrounds

This script was originally built for the SilverIRC IRC-Ops, of which I am
one of three. We use this everyday and have, together, modified it to its
current state. To use this script, just make it executable by executing
"chmod +x /path/to/sIRCOperFilter-v*.pl" and then load it as a script/plugin.
That's it!

Before this script, I hadn't really delved into perl before, and since making
this script, I've come to respect it more and more. I hope you enjoy using it
as much as I enjoyed making it. :)
